# molecule-api

This repository contains every assembled [Molecule.dev](https://www.molecule.dev) API available to the public under an Apache 2.0 license.

Each branch name is a hash of the Molecule's relevant selection. Branches are automatically generated and pushed to this repository as new (unique, unknown) combinations of Molecules are selected and assembled.

To get started assembling your own fully functional, full-stack, cross-platform applications, visit [assemble.molecule.dev](https://assemble.molecule.dev).
